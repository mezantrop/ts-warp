# GUI-WARP macOS all-in-one: TS-Warp + GUI-Warp application

This directory contains source code of TS-Warp project modified to be built as macOS standalone all-in-one application

Check [releases](https://github.com/mezantrop/ts-warp/releases) and download macOS standalone precompiled application or
run [build.sh](build.sh) script to build your own copy.

## Important notes

- Building requires Python3 for macOS with support of **TCL/Tk** and **universal** architecture i.e. downloaded from Python.org
- Source code of the macOS app differs from the "scriped" version of gui-warp.py
- This is an early stage of development, beware of bugs. Let me know if you have some

## TODO

- "About/welcome" tab with a "check for updates"/download link, version number, etc
- Password encoder
- Log-level options
- Active connections: clients - destinations table
