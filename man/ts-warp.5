.SH NAME
\fBTS\-Warp\fR INI-like configuration file format
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBts\-warp\fR uses INI-like configuration files to identify SOCKS servers for destinations that clients are willing to 
reach. The format of ts-warp INI-files are almost dentical to the classical INI dialect, with the only main exception,
that duplicate names for \fBkeys\fR are alloved within the same \fBsection\fR.

Each \fBsection\fR, a string, enclosed in square brackets ('[', ']'), specifies a name for a SOCKS server block. A 
section consists of keys (variables) describing \fBSOCKS server\fR attributes, as well, as keys specifying destination
\fBtargets\fR.

Remarks are specified with: \fB;\fR and \fB#\fR characters

Key names are case insensitive i.e., \fBtarget_host\fR is the same as \fBtArGeT_HoSt\fR
.SH \fBSOCKS server\fR keys
.TP
.B socks_server = <IP | Hostname>[:port]
Manadatory variable, specifying a SOCKS server for the section. Optional port number defaults to 1080.
.BR
.TP
.B socks_chain = SECTION_1, SECTION_N
Defines a chain of sections with SOCKS servers, that are required to reach first before contacting the server in the
current section. Optional variable.
.BR
.TP
.B socks_version = 5 | 4
Specifies the server SOCKS version. Optional, defaults to 5.
.BR
.TP
.B socks_user = username
A username if the server requires authentication. Only plaintext authentication is supported.
.BR
.TP
.B socks_password = plain:PlaintextPassword | tsw01:HEXADECIMALHASH
A user password if the SOCKS-server requires authentication. Can be specified as plaintext if preceded with \fBplain:\fR
prefix or encoded by \fBts-pass(8)\fR with TS-Warp obfuscation algorithm if the \fBtsw01:\fR prefix is set.
.SH \fBTarget\fR keys
.TP
.B target_host = <IP | Hostname>:[port_1[-port_n]]
Describes a single target host either with it's IP address or resolveable host name. Optionally a port or a port range
can be specified to narrow the band. 
.BR
.TP
.B target_domain = example.org:[port_1[-port_n]]
Specifies the name of a domain resolveable via DNS. Optionally a port or a port range can be specified to narrow the
band.
.BR
.TP
.B target_network = IP[:port_1[-port_n]]/Netmask
Specifies an IPv4 or IPv6 subnet. Netmasks are accepted only in dot-decimal notation. Optionally a port or a port range
can be specified to narrow the band.
.BR
.TP
.B target_range = IP_1[:port_1[-port_n]]/IP_n
Specifies a range of sequential IPv4, IPv6 addresses. Optionally a port or a port range can be specified to narrow the
band.
